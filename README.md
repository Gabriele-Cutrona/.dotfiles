Configurations are managed by [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow):
- Waybar configuration from [morrolinux](https://github.com/morrolinux/LinuxRices)

> A little note, the `script.sh` is just for reference, so it's probably not a good idea to try to run it [since i don't even know bash (yet)], and even if you want to run it, make sure you're using Arch Linux or an Arch based distro

## todo
- [x] Neovim (~~nixvim?~~ standalone)
   - [ ] Split init.lua in more files
- [ ] My own waybar config
- [x] My own wofi config
