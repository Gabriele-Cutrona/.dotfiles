# dotFiles
Configurations are managed by [home-manager](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager):
- Various themes by [catppuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin)
- Wofi configuration from [here](https://github.com/nabakdev/dotfiles/tree/main/.config/wofi)
- Waybar configuration from [morrolinux](https://github.com/morrolinux/LinuxRices)

> A little note, the `script.sh` is just for reference, so it's probably not a good idea to try to run it (since i don't even know bash)

## todo
